Big Data Management Final Project 
Nick Pierce

Main Source code in covid_big_data_analytics.ipynb, all code is housed within Jupyter notebook, if environment is not configured properly, notebook may not work correctly. Therefore I recorded a video of my entire notebook running.

I included the raw csv's in covid-19 master 4 which is the download of the John Hopkins GitHub repo which just has all of them in one folder. I showed the process of converting them to a JSON and housing it on a mongoldb cluster in the notebook. I didn't really use atlas that much except for a bit of browsing and uploading, I did show a screenshot or two of it in the report.
